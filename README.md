# Planning-Under-Uncertainty-A-Decision-Theoretic-Perspective-
Book Chapter
ðŸ“– Overview

This chapter provides a comprehensive introduction to planning under uncertainty, a fundamental problem in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Robotics, and Operations Research. Unlike deterministic planning, where outcomes are predictable, planning under uncertainty deals with environments where actions can lead to multiple possible outcomes due to incomplete knowledge, noisy sensors, or stochastic dynamics.
